# genetic-algorithm

implement the Genetic Algorithm with Python to try to solve
the Travelling salesman problem. TSP is an NP-Hard problem that asks the following question:
Given a set of cities (vertices) and the distances between each pair of cities (weighted edges), what
is the shortest possible (weighted) cycle that contains all the cities?

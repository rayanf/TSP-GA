## genetic-algorithm

implement the Genetic Algorithm with Python to try to solve
the Travelling salesman problem. TSP is an NP-Hard problem that asks the following question:
Given a set of cities (vertices) and the distances between each pair of cities (weighted edges), what
is the shortest possible (weighted) cycle that contains all the cities?


## Usage
call training function in main ipynb file.
```python
training(population_n, cor_len, t, selection_per, childs_per, mutation_per, repetition=10, iteration=200):
         cost_history ,path_history = colony.training(50)
```
